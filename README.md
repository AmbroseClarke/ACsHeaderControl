# HTTP Referer modification
This tool allows the customisation of HTTP Web request headers.
This version uses the latest Manifest 3 API. 
This tool collects No user data and nothing but the requested referer header (set via a filter - see below) value are changed.

## Overview

This extension to Chrome removes or modifies the `Referer` header from requests matching custom URL filters.

The number of requests modified by this extension will be displayed on the extension's badge.

You can edit these rules in the manager page.

# HTTP Referer custom - Rule Manager

There is a manager window where rules can be set.

## Implementation Notes

This tool was written as existing extensions to do a similar job (eg. Referer Control) use older APIs and are no longer supported via their website. 

## Installing this extension

Install via the Chrome Web Store

## Does any data get collected?
No data gets stored or transmitted anywhere with this extension or ever will be. 
All code is public and visible here, and is not compressed or obfuscated.
